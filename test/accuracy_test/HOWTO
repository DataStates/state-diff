To verify the effectiveness of our solution using the code in this folder:

* Change the directory in the Makefile to reflect libraries and include locations
  * Add path to the `nvcc_wrapper` file to use to compile this code
  * Add path to the `include` folder in your Kokkos' installation directory
  Add path to the `lib` folder in your Kokkos' installation directory

* Execute the following command. This implementation works for synthetic files. Future updates will introduce HACC which uses a different `file_start_offset` value.

``` 
  make 
```

``` 
  ./run_test 0 <chunk size> <path_to_file_run1> <path_to_file_run2>
```
